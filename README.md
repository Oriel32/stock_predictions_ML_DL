This project focuses on analyzing stock prices and financial news data to build and compare various models for predicting market trends.

It will involve the application of Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for forecasting.

This was the final project of the AI Development course I completed at the Technion â€“ Israel Institute of Technology, for which I received a grade of 100.
